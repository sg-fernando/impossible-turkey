            <h2>Synopsis: </h2>
            <p>Emergency!  Newly discovered lab-grown turkey was grown in a lab in Golden, CO.  
                However, the secret organization, Turkevil, have broken in an deleted all the data on lab-grown turkey creation.  
                Fortunately, the researchers have discovered that all hope isn't loss, and if
                they can get their hands on a sample of lab-grown turkey, they get its DNA and be able to 
                recover much of their research.  However, the facility and heavily gaurded, and there's no way for 
                researchers to break in.  In hearing this, members of Turkevil have now begun searching for pieces
                of lab-grown turkey, with the intent to destroy any remnants of it.
            </p>
            <h2>Instructions: </h2>
            <p>You, as the LAST piece of lab-grown turkey, need to escape to the outside world and avoid being destroyed
                by members of Turkevil.
